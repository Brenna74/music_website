					<H1>On The Music Scene</H1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Vaporwave's explicit effects on the music scene have been largely non-existant. Even at it's height, vaporwave was still very much a niche genre, and the few fans that still remain, decry it's oncoming death- and have for the past few years. That's not to say that it hasn't made it's mark on music: This interest in sampling, electronica and obsfucation of instrument sounds has bled through to more mainstream artists. Arcade Fire's most recent album, "Everything Now", for example, speaks on much the same topics as Vaporwave. Conformity, materialism, the hopelessness of having everything and feeling empty. It diverges noticeably from their previous album to take on a more synth-pop tone, while still very much keeping their grand, orchestratal mark. Other popular artists such as Gorillaz with their newest album "Humanz", and The Avalanches 2016 album "Wildflower" very much address the same topic, but perhaps, in a more appealing way than vaporwave.

				<p>While it remains to be seen if Vaporwave in one form or another sticks around, and if its uniquely intangible sound influenced by the world we live in inspired other artists' or was simply an early-rider on an overarching musical trend, vaporwave can only be seen as the purest response. It's intentionally obscure personality, it's decentralized presence, it's rapid popularity and subsequent collapse, numerous offshoots and subgenres, are near mirrors to what the internet truly is.</p>

				<p>
					Vaporwave as a music genre and vaporwave as an internet meme are inexorably linked, yet very different beasts. While there is a case for which truly came first, vaporwave's success and popularity are definitely tied to the countless internet jokes, satirical videos and semi-sarcastic "A E S T H E T I C" comments that the internet made popular on message boards and youtube. Even it's most famous song, "MACINTOSH PLUS - リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー", is something of a joke now. Usually it is used in faux-philosophical videos, with such thought provoking questions as "Are lobsters the mermaids of scorpsions?", and "When you get a bigger bed, you get more bed room but less bedroom." followed by the hook of the song, and a humourous expression freezeframed and slowly panning in towards it.
