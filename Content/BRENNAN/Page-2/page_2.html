			<H1>Evolution of pop music</H1>
		</header>
		<p>During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word "progressive" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a "progression" from the last.</p>
		<p>Indie pop emerged in the late 1970s, marking another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, formed on the then-novel premise that it was possible to record and release your own music without having to get a record contract from a major label.</p>
		<p>In the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which allowed artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna to gain popularity based not only on their music but also on their looks.</p>
